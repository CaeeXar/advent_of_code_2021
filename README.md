## Description

This is my take on the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021), written in NodeJS.

## Usage

### Initialize a new day

```bash
npm start init 01 # the day you want to initialize
```

### Execute day

```bash
npm start exec day01 # run part one and two of day01
npm start exec -1 day01 # run part one of day01

```
